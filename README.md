# 📊 TalendETLProject – Data Intelligence Platform

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **PABI – 4th Year Engineering Program** at **Esprit School of Engineering** (Academic Year 2025–2026).

It is a end-to-end **Data Intelligence platform** built following the **GIMSI methodology**, covering data ingestion, transformation, warehousing, visualization, machine learning, and web deployment.

The solution enables decision-makers to gain actionable insights through automated ETL pipelines, interactive Power BI dashboards, and ML-powered predictions.

## Features

- 🔄 **ETL Pipelines** – Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading using Talend Open Studio
- 🏗️ **Data Warehouse** – Structured DW schema designed for analytical queries
- 📊 **Power BI Dashboards** – Interactive reports with KPIs and business insights
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** – Predictive models trained, tuned and evaluated (Accuracy, F1-Score, RMSE)
- ⚙️ **Workflow Automation** – Orchestration of data jobs and automation using n8n
- 🌐 **Web Application** – A wrapper web app exposing the solution to end users
- 🚀 **MLOps Pipeline** – Model deployment, monitoring and drift tracking

The project follows the **GIMSI methodology** across 4 phases:

1. **Identification** – Topic assignment, team setup, initial EDA, specifications draft
2. **Design** – DW schema, KPI definition, dashboard mockups, web scraping, architecture validation
3. **Implementation** – ETL development, DW population, Power BI V1, ML training, n8n automation, web app deployment
4. **Permanent Improvement** – System audit, MLOps monitoring, end-to-end testing, final defense

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Talend Open Studio installed
- Power BI Desktop installed
- Python 3.x + pip
- Node.js (for web app)
- n8n (local or cloud)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chaima-Cherif391/Esprit-PABI-4ERP-BI7-2026-TalendETLProject.git

# Navigate to the project
cd Esprit-PABI-4ERP-BI7-2026-TalendETLProject

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the ETL
```bash
# Open Talend Open Studio and import the jobs from /talend folder
# Run jobs in order: Staging → Transform → DW Load
```

### Viewing Dashboards
```bash
# Open /powerbi/dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop
# Or access the published report via the link below:
# [Power BI Report Link] → à ajouter
```
